/**
 * These bank accounts are payment methods on <code>Customer</code> objects.
 *
 * On the other hand <a
 * href="https://stripe.com/docs/api#external_accounts">External Accounts</a> are
 * transfer destinations on <code>Account</code> objects for <a
 * href="https://stripe.com/docs/connect/custom-accounts">Custom accounts</a>. They
 * can be bank accounts or debit cards as well, and are documented in the links
 * above.

 * Transfers</a>.
 *
 * @property string $id Unique identifier for the object.
 * @property string $object String representing the object's type. Objects of the same type share the same value.
 * @property null|string|\Stripe\Account $account The ID of the account that the bank account is associated with.
 * @property null|string $account_holder_name The name of the person or business that owns the bank account.
 * @property null|string $account_holder_type The type of entity that holds the account. This can be either <code>individual</code> or <code>company</code>.
 * @property null|string[] $available_payout_methods A set of available payout methods for this bank account. Only values from this set should be passed as the <code>method</code> when creating a payout.
 * @property null|string $bank_name Name of the bank associated with the routing number (e.g., <code>WELLS FARGO</code>).
 * @property string $country Two-letter ISO code representing the country the bank account is located in.
 * @property string $currency Three-letter <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/payouts">ISO code for the currency</a> paid out to the bank account.
 * @property null|string|\Stripe\Customer $customer The ID of the customer that the bank account is associated with.
 * @property null|bool $default_for_currency Whether this bank account is the default external account for its currency.
 * @property null|string $fingerprint Uniquely identifies this particular bank account. You can use this attribute to check whether two bank accounts are the same.
 * @property string $last4 The last four digits of the bank account number.
 * @property null|\Stripe\StripeObject $metadata Set of <a href="https://stripe.com/docs/api/metadata">key-value pairs</a> that you can attach to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format.
 * @property null|string $routing_number The routing transit number for the bank account.
 * @property string $status <p>For bank accounts, possible values are <code>new</code>, <code>validated</code>, <code>verified</code>, <code>verification_failed</code>, or <code>errored</code>. A bank account that hasn't had any activity or validation performed is <code>new</code>. If Stripe can determine that the bank account exists, its status will be <code>validated</code>. Note that there often isnâ€™t enough information to know (e.g., for smaller credit unions), and the validation is not always run. If customer bank account verification has succeeded, the bank account status will be <code>verified</code>. If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be <code>verification_failed</code>. If a transfer sent to this bank account fails, we'll set the status to <code>errored</code> and will not continue to send transfers until the bank details are updated.</p><p>For external accounts, possible values are <code>new</code> and <code>errored</code>. Validations aren't run against external accounts because they're only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don't apply. If a transfer fails, the status is set to <code>errored</code> and transfers are stopped until account details are updated.</p>
