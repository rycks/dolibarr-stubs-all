     *
     * Often you want to return an instance of the current class, but you are
     * free to return other data as well.

     * next element. Not doing anything will result in a never-ending loop.
     *
     * If you just want to skip parsing for this element altogether, you can
     * just call $reader->next();
     *
     * $reader->parseInnerTree() will parse the entire sub-tree, and advance to
     * the next element.
