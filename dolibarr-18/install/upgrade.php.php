 * Upgrade scripts can be ran from command line with syntax:
 *
 * cd htdocs/install
 * php upgrade.php 3.4.0 3.5.0 [dirmodule|ignoredbversion]
 * php upgrade2.php 3.4.0 3.5.0 [MODULE_NAME1_TO_ENABLE,MODULE_NAME2_TO_ENABLE]
 *
 * And for final step:
 * php step5.php 3.4.0 3.5.0
 *
 * Option 'dirmodule' allows to provide a path for an external module, so we migrate from command line using a script from a module.
 * Option 'ignoredbversion' allows to run migration even if database version does not match start version of migration
 * Return code is 0 if OK, >0 if error
