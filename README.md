# Dolibarr Stubs (all stubs in one repository)

The stubs are generated directly from the dolibarr [sources](https://github.com/dolibarr/dolibarr) using [dolibarr-stubs] tools (https://github.com/rycks/dolibarr-stubs).

## Usage in PHPStan

For example you can include stubs in PHPStan configuration file with

```yaml
parameters:
	scanDirectories:
		- /your_path/dolibarr-stubs-all/dolibarr-18/
	excludePaths:
		analyse:
			- /your_path/dolibarr-stubs-all/dolibarr-18/
```
